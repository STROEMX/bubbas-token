This repository contains the canonical ERC20 token contract for Bubbas ($BUBBAS).

The contract serves as a **GameFi settlement and enforcement layer**, authorizing a protocol engine to execute deterministic, on-chain distributions and applying a dynamic, external-only transaction tax to fund holder reflections, circulation reduction, jackpots, and ecosystem development.

Internal platform interactions are tax-free. The total supply is fixed and non-inflationary. All allocation rules and distribution constraints are transparent, auditable, and enforced directly at the smart-contract level.
