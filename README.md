This repository contains the canonical ERC20 token contract for Bubbas ($BUBBAS).
The contract implements the Bubba Engine, a deterministic, on-chain transaction model that applies a dynamic external-only tax to fund holder reflections, circulation reduction, jackpots, and ecosystem development.

Internal platform interactions are tax-free. The total supply is fixed and non-inflationary. All allocation logic is transparent, auditable, and enforced at the smart-contract level.
